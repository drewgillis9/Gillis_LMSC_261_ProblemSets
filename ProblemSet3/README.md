###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to get acquainted with C language and programming inside of Microsoft Virtual Studio Code. We learned to set variables and use the printf function, which we loaded from our first library.

###Description

The problem set 3.1 taught us how to navigate Terminal on Mac using the `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` commands. These help move, uncover, and locate current location in the file system within Finder.

The problem set 3.2 taught us how to compile code that we create. Compiling is important because the computer cannot read words that we type in code, so we must transfer the code into binary for the computer to output the right message. We use `clang` to compile our code.

The problem set 3.3 told us to rename our compiled files to a name that would help us locate and use the file easier. I did this just to reflect which problem set I was following, but I wasn't sure if the .out could be taken out.

The problem set 3.4 taught us how to use the `printf` function in C, along with using `\n` and `\t` to create new lines and new tabs in the message.

The problem set 3.5 had us create variables using the `int` and `float` variable descriptions, in order to reflect the day's weather. We manually plugged in the values ourselves, we just needed the `printf` to read all of the correct values in good formatting.

###Build and Run Commands

The problem sets 3.1-3.3 did not require any build and run commands to run.

The problem sets 3.4 and 3.5 required clang to compile the code once it was correct, then we had to read it from binary by using `./a.out` in Terminal.

###Acknowledgements 

I worked with Leah Gutman on this assignment because I could not figure out why my formatting of the `\t` was incorrect with my code.
