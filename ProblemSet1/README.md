###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use GitHub and Markdown.

###Description

The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git version control system with GitHub. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/GitHub to understand how to version control software. The Problem Set 1.2 was about writing a read me. In it, we were required to use syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--` to format the README.md file so that the file is formatted nicely on GitHub when it is displayed.
