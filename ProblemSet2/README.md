###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Scratch in order to make a unique and creative code with at least:

* two different sprites; 
* three different scripts; 
* one condition, loop, and variable;
* one sound;
* and one custom block.

It is easy to do so with the materials and examples given in class, so in order to show what we have learned and how to use it, uniqueness may have been the most important part of the problem set.

###Description

The Problem Set 2.1 covered how to use Scratch as an extremely basic example of a programming language. I had to learn and know how to use the given blocks and sprites, and understand how to manipulate the sprites using specific orders of blocks. The Problem Set 2.2 was given to further our understanding of Scratch by having us create a unique "code" that manipulated multiple sprites in many different ways. We were required to use loops, blocks, conditions, variables, scripts, and sounds in this Problem Set. 

I created a baseball "video game" in which a ball is thrown to the catcher when the green flag is clicked, and the batter swings when directed b y the user with the space bar. If timed correctly, the hitter will hit the ball to the opposite field and think, "thank god i dont play for the astros", a play on the cheating reports against the Houston Astros in which the hitters stole signs electronically and eventually led the team to a World Series title. If the hitter misses, however, the catcher exclaims, "Strike 3!" There were a couple tricky parts to code, such as setting the timing for the hitter's open window using y-coordinates of the ball; however, the hardest part was using if/else commands to say when the contact would either be true or false. I used a block for part of this code because I kept having to reorient the surrounding code.

###Build and Run Commands

The Problem Set 2.1 does not require any build and run commands. 

In order to run Problem Set 2.2, the user must click the green flag to "throw" the pitch, then press the space bar at the correct time to hit the ball with the batter.
