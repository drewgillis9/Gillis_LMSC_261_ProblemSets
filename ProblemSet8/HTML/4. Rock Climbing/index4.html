            <p>I've been a rock climber since I was 12. I used to be a competition climber, but now climb recreationally both indoors and outdoors.</p>

            <p>I typically prefer bouldering, which is a short height, no-rope version of climbing. My brother and I take crash pads out into parks in New England and will climb routes 10-15 feet high.</p>

            <p>I also top rope occasionally, which is the standard version of climbing with ropes climbing higher distances. My brother and I recently did this next to a waterfall near Washington, D.C. over Thanksgiving break.</p>
