###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to combine HTML and CSS code to create a webpage with design.

###Description

The Problem Set 8.1 had us use multiple components to design a webpage using HTML and CSS. We had to use 5 different CSS tags and selectors, along with 10 HTML tags, and incorporate one selector from Bootstrap online. I used these to format my text mainly, but also was able to alter the background color using CSS. 

The text formatting can be done using HTML, but the reason we were using CSS here was because it is a one time fits all applicatioin. Once you greate a CSS selector inside of the styles.css file, you can easily apply these settings to any section of your HTML code. In a way, it is like a function in C because it shortens your code, like a shortcut.

I had a lot of trouble using hyperlinks in my code. You can see where I tried to implement them - on the bolded 3 words in my front page, then on the word return in my other 3 pages. In would love to go over this a bit in class next week if we get the chance. 

###Build and Run Commands

To run the server, the command http-server must be used in terminal to get from my HTML to the webpade.

###Acknowledgements

I used a couple websites to help with Bootstrap and CSS selectors. They are linked below.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/position/)
