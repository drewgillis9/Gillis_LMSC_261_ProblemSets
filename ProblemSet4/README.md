###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use mathematical equations inside of a code to specific numbers/variables, and to teach us how to use coexisting `for` loops with coexisting and interacting variables.

###Description

The Problem Set 4.1 had us working with previous code, but creating an equation to change temperature values from Farenheit to Celsius. All we had to do was plug in the equation immediately following the correct variables inside of the `printf` function, and we used `-` and `/` to perform math functions.

The Problem Set 4.2 had us create a variable called stacks that would create a sort of diamond printed using `#`s. The first row would have 1 #, the second would have 2 #s, and so on for integers 1-8. This was accomplished using two `for` loops, one inside of the other, and using two different variables to distinguish rows from columns. At first, I was attempting to create a stack function, not variable; it worked, except I could not set parameters on the variable `n` to keep the function between integers 1-8. You can check out what I did in file Stack Function not Variable.c. 

###Build and Run Commands

The Problem Sets 4.1 and 4.2 require `clang` to compile the code, then `./a.out` to read it back from binary into English.
