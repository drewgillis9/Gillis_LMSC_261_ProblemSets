###Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Python in similar ways that we have used C, and recognizing different commands/syntax.

###Description

The Problem Set 9.1 had us perform a math equation using `input`, a new command in Python. This code was extremely straightforward - the only thing of note was using f inside the `print` command in order to reduce white spaces. Just a quirk of Python.

The Problem Set 9.2 had us perform an identical exercise to a previous problem set, but this time in Python. I originally thought they would be quite similar, but the difference in the `for` loops really threw me for a loop. The most fun part of this problem set was setting boundaries on user input between numbers 1-8. I used an `if` statement to complete this, and simply set values inside of `<=` and `>=` to finish it off. 

The Problem Set 9.3 had us complete another very similar task to a previous problem, which took numbers out of a string and left only letters and special characters. This time, we ran it using user input, so I saved the input into a variable `str`. I have no idea how to get this code to work with ASCII values - for some reason, simply nothing I did made any difference. I'd love to cover this more in the future. For this instance, I used help from a website that utilizied new commands. I ran those commands inside the `removeDigit` function, then inside `main` to complete the code.

###Build and Run Commands

Simply performing `python3 *filename*` into terminal will run each code. User input is required as well, inside of terminal.

###Acknowledgements

I used a website to help with separation of numbers and letters in 9.3, since I could not figure out how to do so. with ASCII. The website is listed below.
