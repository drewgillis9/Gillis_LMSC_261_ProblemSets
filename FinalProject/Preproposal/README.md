##Preproposal


###What ideas do I have for my final project?

I have a couple ideas inside the realm of baseball statistics. The first is to use statistical analysis to find likelihood of either the Braves or the Dodgers winning a 7-game playoff series based on hitters'/pitchers' lefty-righty splits and using the starting lineups/rotations for each time; the second is to project the future average season for a minor league player using scout grades and previous triple crown statistics at lower minor league levels.

If neither of these are doable, I'd love to make an HTML/CSS based informative website about the history of Negro League Baseball.

###Do I have any questions?

More than anything, I'm wondering if either of the first two are possible. But I'm also wondering if we can use more than one language in the final project, or if that breaks the rules/will make the project incredibly messy.
