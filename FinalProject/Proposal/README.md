##Proposal

###What will (likely) be the title of your project?

MLB Draft Picks and Career Success

###In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A statistical research compiling active MLB players' draft picks, years in the major leagues, and career WAR (a stat that tracks success over all facets of the game comparatively to every player in history).

###In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be able to extract data from CSV files that include the above listed parameters: active MLB players' draft picks, years in the major leagues, and career WAR. By putting those. onto a table, I will then use pandas to do some statistical research and computation to discover if there is a direct correlation between when a player was picked in the draft, and his future career WAR standing. I will compare the categories and run a regression to find correlation.

##In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

###In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will find whether there is a correlation between draft pick and career WAR.

###In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will discover if there is a linear. regression starting from pick 1 going down, or if there is a certain pick which is most optimal for teams to have in order to get the best success from their player. This could indicate that teams should trade to get certain picks over others, or a range of picks that are more ideal than others.

###In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to discover if this possible correlation has anything to do with minor league experience and/or player age as well. Certain players get drafted much higher because they are seen to be "pro-ready" at a higher age than some, but others are seen for their huge potential and are drafted 4 or 5 years younger. I'd like to know if this fits the model that the previous examples have found, or if this is a separate idea.

###In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I'll need to get a lot better with statistical work, especially in Python. Fortunately there are programs that help make stat coding in Python similar to R, so I can combine the 2 to help out with my previous experience in R.
