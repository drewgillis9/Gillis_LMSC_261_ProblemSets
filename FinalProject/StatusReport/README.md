###What have you done for your project so far?

I have created an utilized .csv files made in bexcel to call data about current avtive players in the MLB. I have begun to write code in pandas for statistical use, in order to find regressions between the statistics.

###What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not come far with pandas, due to unfamiliarity. I also have not begun researching a possible point of inflection for when draft stock takes a downturn.

###What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Pandas has not come easily, but I have help from family and friends with the statistics. My brother is also adept in pandas, so he and I have been on zoom calls to discuss ways to take mny code further and more efficiently.
